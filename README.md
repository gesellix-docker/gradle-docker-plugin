Yet another Gradle plugin making it easy for your build scripts to talk to a Docker daemon. Each task delegates to the [Docker-Client](https://github.com/cryptoki/docker-client), which connects to the
Docker remote API via HTTP.

For basic usage please have a look at the tests or the [example project](https://github.com/cryptoki/gradle-docker-plugin-example).
