Yet another Gradle plugin making it easy for your build scripts to talk to a Docker daemon.
Each task delegates to the [Docker-Client](https://github.com/gesellix/docker-client), which connects
to the Docker remote API via HTTP.

For basic usage please have a look at the tests or the [example project](https://github.com/gesellix/gradle-docker-plugin-example).

## Release Workflow

There are multiple GitHub Action Workflows for the different steps in the package's lifecycle:

- CI: Builds and checks incoming changes on a pull request
  - triggered on every push to a non-default branch
- CD: Publishes the Gradle artifacts to GitHub Package Registry
  - triggered only on pushes to the default branch
- Release: Publishes Gradle artifacts to Sonatype and releases them to Maven Central
  - triggered on a published GitHub release using the underlying tag as artifact version, e.g. via `git tag -m "$MESSAGE" v$(date +"%Y-%m-%dT%H-%M-%S")`
